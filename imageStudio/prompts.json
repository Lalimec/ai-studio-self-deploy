Next to the screen, include a toy packaging box designed in the style of premium collectible merchandise, printed with original artwork. The packaging is a BANDAl-style toy packaging box printed with the original artwork and the name of the character. The room is a well lit warm and cozy environment with natural light from window, high quality bright cinematic lighting, resembling a premium product photography."

The photo should have a slight blur effect and a consistent light source, like a flash from a dark room, spread throughout the photo. DO NOT CHANGE THE FACES AT ALL. Replace the background behind with white curtains. If there are multiple people in the image they people should be hugging each other with smiles, looking very happy. Single people should be posing to the camera happily. Subtle instant-film imperfections visible: light grain, soft vignette, faint light leak. Bright yet natural tones, cinematic detail, authentic romantic moment frozen in an instant-photo style. Do not add any text on the photo."
